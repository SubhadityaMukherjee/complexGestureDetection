# Complex Gesture Detection

- This project aims to identify and sequence Complex gestures such as hand waves from a video input.
- It is very much a work in progress and a relatively larger project with many tasks to it.
- A sort of roadmap is below for features I plan to implement and those already done

## Components

- Collect/create data
- Hand recognizer
- Keypoint segmentation (use mediapipe??)
- Write to data in segments of 3 seconds
- Basic LSTM
- Further experiments

## Done
